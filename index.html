<h1>BZcomfort</h1>
<p>Dr Andrew Speak from the University of Bozen-Bolzano built the BZcomfort app as a Free app. This application is provided by BZcomfort at no cost and is intended for gathering data on thermal comfort from citizens and visitors in the city of Bolzano.
This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for scientific research on the thermal comfort conditions in public spaces of Bolzano. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The app does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.  The data will be stored on a password protected Google spreadsheet, and every day this data will be removed from the spreadsheet and stored in an offline secure database.  All personal data collected in the first stage of using the app will be used as variables in a thermal comfort model for the city.  The email will be used as a unique identifier, and also to inform the winner of the gift voucher.
The answers to the questionnaire section will be shared anonymously with Bolzano city council.  The reason for this is that the public perceptions and opinions on public trees are important to the council and the answers may be used to help improve public tree management.
The map game requires the user to share their location.  The location will only be recorded once you are in one of the four designated public space study sites.  The location will be stored as a single latitude and longitude of the location where you completed the thermal comfort questionnaire which appears when you arrive at one of the four locations.  The date, time and location sensor accuracy will also be recorded for research purposes.  This data will also be treated with the utmost security and will be stored in a password protected Google spreadsheet, which will be checked every day, and data transferred to a secure offline database and deleted from the spreadsheet.</p>
